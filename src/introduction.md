# Zook, a book for the Zig programming language

This book is intended to be a gentle introduction to the
[Zig](https://ziglang.org) programming language.


## What is Zig?
Quoting from the official website -
> Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain
> for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.

Some of its features are - 
- No hidden control flow
- No hidden memory allocations
- No preprocessor, no macros

It takes a novel approach to compile time metaprogramming
through [comptime]() which allows us write code that
runs at compile time in virtually the same way as regular
code.

It also acts toolchain for compiling C/C++ projects.
The Zig executable allows us to compile existing 
codebases without changing anything.

## Personal Notes
According to someone, `zook` means arse in morrocan.
I have not independently verified this claim but
left it as an exercise to the reader.
